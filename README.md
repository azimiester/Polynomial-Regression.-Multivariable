# Polynomial-Regression.-Multivariable
I used psuedo-inverse method to predict the number of upvotes a review will have using bag of words model.

It could have used some more commenting and using more native functions but it got the job done nonetheless. It got the accuracy of 97% with current settings, you can tinker around with hyperparameters to see if you can enhance it. Shoot me an email at azmaktr@gmail.com if you want to know something about it.
